## Reporting a Vulnerability

I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue ... open an issue :smiley:.

And after the initial check of the issue, I will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
